# Redmine Mondoshawan
Uses redmine api to automatically fill up time entries to complete your working day.

As that Mondoshawan said in [The Fifth Element](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119116/):

> Time not important. Only life important

If you are too busy coding or trying to solve real problems you can use this script to fill up time entries in your asigned issues (randomly) to your working day is completed. You can edit those time entries manually later if you have enough time!
